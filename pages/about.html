            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>Avillion LLC is a logistics company based in St. Louis, MO, that was founded by
                    three young professionals with different backgrounds but a common vision: to
                    create a reliable, efficient and innovative freight broker service that can handle
                    any transportation needs. The founders are:</p>
                <p>Adnan Imamovic, a software developer and accountant who has a passion for
                    creating smart solutions for complex problems. He is the registered agent and
                    the owner of Avillion LLC.</p>

                <p>Daniel E. Heco, an architectural engineer who has a flair for creating and
                    managing projects and structures. He is the Accounts Director, Sales and
                    the head of business development of Avillion LLC.</p>

                <p>Benjamin Zelihic, a passionate english linguist who has a knack for designing
                    and optimizing systems and processes as a software developer as well.
                    He is is the chief operations officer and the head of quality control of Avillion LLC.</p>

                <p>The three met at a local meetup for entrepreneurs and innovators, where they
                    discovered their shared interest in logistics and transportation. They decided
                    to join forces and start their own company, which they named Avillion LLC, after
                    the word “pikoura”, which means “three” in Maori, a language spoken by the
                    indigenous people of New Zealand.</p>

                <p>Avillion LLC was officially launched on November 21, 2022, with a mission to
                    provide transportation services for vans, flatbeds, reefers, dry bulk, tankers
                    and coal/coke2. The company uses advanced technology and data analytics
                    to find the best carriers and routes for each shipment, ensuring that
                    the goods are delivered on time and in good condition. The company also
                    offers competitive rates and personalized customer service to its clients.</p>
                <p>One of the first clients of Avillion LLC was Castle Tires ,a recycling service
                    center located in Portland, OR. Castle Tire LLC needed a reliable freight
                    forwarder to handle their shipments of raw materials and finished products
                    across the country. Avillion LLC impressed them with their professionalism,
                    efficiency and innovation, and soon became their preferred logistics partner.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>Another client of Avillion LLC was Enza Inc, a trucking company that
                    operates in various states. Enza Inc needed a freight broker to help
                    them find more loads and optimize their routes. Avillion LLC provided
                    them with a user-friendly platform that allowed them to access
                    real-time information on available loads, rates and locations. Avillion LLC
                    also helped them improve their fuel efficiency and safety by using smart
                    algorithms and GPS tracking.</p>

                <p>Avillion LLC has grown rapidly since its inception, thanks to its loyal
                    customers and its dedicated team. The company now has more
                    than 17 employees, including drivers, dispatchers, account
                    managers and support staff. The company also has a network
                    of more than 500 carriers across the country, covering all types
                    of cargo and modes of transportation.</p>

                <p>Avillion LLC is not only a successful business, but also a socially
                    responsible one. The company supports various causes and
                    charities in its community, such as environmental protection,
                    education and health care. The company also promotes diversity
                    and inclusion in its workplace, hiring people from different
                    backgrounds, cultures and experiences.</p>

                <p>Avillion LLC is a story of passion and innovation, of three young
                    professionals who turned their dream into reality. The company
                    is still growing and evolving, always looking for new ways to
                    improve its services and satisfy its customers. Avillion LLC is not
                    just a logistics company, but a logistics solution.</p>
