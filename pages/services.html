                   and pharmaceuticals that need to be kept at a regulated 
                   temperature during the shipping process4 . Refrigerated 
                   transportation is a critical component of the cold chain and helps
                    to reduce food losses and ensure safety and quality. Avillion has

                <h2 class="text-uppercase">DROP TRAILER PROJECTS</h2>
                <p>Avillion also offers logistics services for DROP TRAILER CAPACITY, which is a method
                    of shipment and transport where drivers bring their trailer shipment to a warehouse 
                   and “drop” it off there. One driver can then hook up their truck to a new trailer
                    that warehouse workers already loaded and prepared. DROP TRAILER PROJECTS 
                   allow for more efficiency and flexibility in the supply chain, as drivers do not have to 
                   wait for loading or unloading and can move on to their next destination faster. 
                   DROP TRAILER PROJECTS also reduce detention fees, driver wait time, and congestion 
                   at the docks. Avillion has a fleet of modern and well-maintained trucks and trailers t
                   hat can handle any type of cargo that requires DROP TRAILER PROJECTS.
